# Hello Markdown!

It is **sooo** nice to be able to write in the simple format.

Once you get the hanke of *it*, you just:

* Remember the basic syntax
* Write your doc
* Done!

Now you can be a Wiz at this language and code up stuff like `console.writeline("Hello Markdown!");`

Can't remember the language?  No problem!  Just visit one of these resources:
